    body: "Many of our first dates were climbing trips to the nearby Smith Rock in Central Oregon. We quickly fell in love and it wasn’t long before we were spending lots of time together in Bend outside of climbing. For a while, Tate was travelling and frequently away for months at a time. We made the long distance relationship work for a bit, but decided it would be much nicer to live together. ",

    body: "We rented a nice cabin in the woods in Northwest Bend from some good friends for a couple of years. Here we learned how to live and work together as a team. Living with somebody is always a test of a relationship, but one of the most amazing things about us is that we are always able to quickly resolve the rare disagreements we have. During this time the deeper, stronger foundation of our future was established.  ",

    body: "We adopted an adorable border collie puppy which we named Freddie Mercury. Early on, Freddie proved to be a hilarious, but loving dog. As a puppy, he loved to chase pine cones. He would carry them up to the top of a small hill, and let them roll down so that he could chase them with his paws until they got to the bottom, where he would pick them up and start over. He is a year and half now, and wins the hearts of everyone he meets with his big, loving brown eyes and floppy ears. ",

    body: "Around the beginning of 2020 we were ready for a new stage in life. We began searching for a house to buy, and settled on a place closer to Smith Rock in Redmond, Oregon. We immediately fell in love with the huge backyard and its proximity to the outdoor activities we enjoy. The tradeoff for this dreamhouse was that it is from the 1970’s and requires quite a bit of fixing up. But we are enjoying the process of learning all about home repairs, and are still happily living in our small slice of paradise while we build it. ",

    title: 'The proposal',
    body: 'In June of 2020, Tate proposed to Hannah in a way that surprised them both. He had gotten a beautiful ring made by his sister, Nichole, who is a talented Jeweler. During that process it had been quite difficult to conceal that he was having a ring made, so Hannah had some suspicions surrounding upcoming events. He had thought a cool hike, or bike ride to some epic location was in order so that he could do the classic outdoors proposal. One summer evening we were both enjoying time together in our wonderful new home playing our favorite video game, Breath of the Wild. A great sense of love and appreciation welled up inside of Tate for this amazing woman. A profound realization came across him of how lucky he was to have someone that loves all the things that he loves. He decided right then and there was the time to ask her to marry him. And fortunately, she said yes!'
